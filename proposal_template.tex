\paragraph*{Game description.}
Describe the game you plan to implement briefly. What is the idea? What are its key elements? What is its goal (or goals)? What are the educational components? What is the target audience?  \ Are you planning to use Unity or Unreal? Please also write a few sentences  for the following components:

This is a puzzle/memory game, where the player controls an avatar which they need to guide along a path to the end zone. The path is visible for a certain amount of time before it disappears, after which the player needs to use their memory to finish the level. The player is given a few mechanics (such as a boost) at their disposal which helps them traverse quickly but at the same time requiring more precise inputs.

The educational component here is the memory aspect; we also intend for this game to require precise timing and inputs. The target audience is to be players of all ages.

We intend to use Unity for this project.

\begin{itemize}
\item What are you trying to teach through this game?

We want to teach visual memory skills here, as well as challenging the player to innovate when it comes to traversing the levels. We don't intend for every level in our game to be beaten via the "direct path" to the exist, though the player is absolutely welcome to do so.

\item 3D world and characters (e.g., will it be an open/closed environment? what type of objects/entities will it contain? Will it involve one or multiple human players (i.e., networking)? Will there be any AI characters?)

\item Game mechanics (e.g., what the player(s) will do? How does the environment change or what other entities do in response to the playerâ€™'s actions?)

\item Animation (e.g., will you use physics-based animation, rigid body simulation, hard-coded animations, keyframe animations, etc?)
\item User interface and sound (will the game have any menus? what input devices/sensors do you plan to use? Will it work on a mobile phone? Will there be any sound effects?)
\end{itemize}

If you want to show any images (e.g., sketches, screenshots, etc) to explain your plan better, you are more than welcome to do so! Anything that will help me understand what you are planning to do will be useful.  


\paragraph{Split of the work.}
Provide  a rough breakdown of the tasks each group member will focus on. You do not need to include this paragraph if you do not plan to work in groups.
